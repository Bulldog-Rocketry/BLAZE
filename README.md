# BLITS

The "Ballistic Long-range Ignition Testing System" system combines the Avionics STIS (Static Test Ignition System) functionality with additional pressure and temperature data acquisition. The BLITS software will run on a Raspberry Pi. The BLITS system Boombox will input serial data into the Raspberry Pi via one USB cable providing thrust, pressure, and temperature data. The Raspberry Pi will work to store the data as it comes in. The BLITS system Boombox will work with the Avionics handheld Football to control the ignition of our rocket motor, in addition to collecting thrust, pressure, and temperature data as it comes in, and sending it to the Raspberry Pi.

This system is a combination of the Avionics committee's Static Test Ignition System and the Hybrid Control System. Once this system is complete, it will be compatible for use with solid motor tests, hybrid motor tests, and the strand burner project.
