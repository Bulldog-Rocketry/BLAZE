# BLAZE

The "Ballistic Load Analysis with Zero Effort" system combines the Avionics STIS (Static Test Ignition System) functionality with additional pressure and temperature data acquisition. The BLAZE software will run on a Raspberry Pi. The BLAZE system Boombox will input serial data into the Raspberry Pi via three USB cables providing thrust, pressure, and temperature data. The Raspberry Pi will work to store the data as it comes in. The BLAZE system Boombox will work with the Avionics handheld Football to control the ignition of our rocket motor, in addition to collecting thrust, pressure, and temperature data as it comes in, and sending it to the Raspberry Pi.
